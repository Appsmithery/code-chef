# Linear Project Registry
#
# Maps project names to Linear project IDs for client scoping.
#
# Structure:
#   project-name:
#     project_id: <Linear project UUID>
#     team_id: <Linear team UUID>
#     description: <Human-readable description>
#
# Usage:
#   linear_client = get_linear_client(agent_name="feature-dev", project_name="phase-5-chat")
#
# Security:
#   - Subagents can only access their assigned project
#   - Orchestrator has workspace-level access (no project scoping)
