# Dev-Tools Codebase Index (Migration Placeholder)

> Canonical codebase inventory generated by `npm run validate:codebase` once the diagnostics tooling has been ported.

During the Phase 1 migration the codebase indexing scripts have not yet been copied over from the legacy repository. This placeholder keeps the documentation structure intact and captures the regeneration procedure.

## Regeneration Checklist

1. Port the diagnostics utilities from `operations/diagnostics/` in the legacy repository:
   - `collect-env.ts`
   - `scan-repo-structure.ts`
   - `inventory-packages.ts`
   - `update-codebase-index.mjs`
2. Ensure `npm run validate:codebase` (or the equivalent Taskfile target) is wired up in `package.json`.
3. Run the generator from the repository root:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:codebase
   ```
4. Commit the regenerated `docs/CODEBASE_INDEX.md` together with any supporting report artifacts under `reports/context/latest/`.

## Temporary Content

While the full index is pending regeneration, use the following sources for repository discovery:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the target directory layout.
- `docs/REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md` for the migration task list.
- `context/_repo-GPS/repo-folder-tree.txt` (when available) for historical file trees.

Once the diagnostics toolkit has been migrated, replace this placeholder with the auto-generated index.
