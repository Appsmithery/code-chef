# INTEGRATION NOTES
# ============================================================================

integration_guidance:
  cross_agent_coordination:
    - "All agents MUST log to memory server to build shared knowledge graph"
    - "Use notion as single source of truth for task specifications and status"
    - "Prefer gitmcp for all source control operations to maintain consistent commit context"
    - "Route all container operations through dockerhub server for unified image management"

  access_control:
    - "Orchestrator has unrestricted access to all tools"
    - "Feature-dev and infrastructure have write access to rust-mcp-filesystem"
    - "Code-review has read-only access to gitmcp and filesystem"
    - "CI/CD has container exec privileges via dockerhub"
    - "Documentation has read-mostly access with targeted write for docs/ directories"

  failure_handling:
    - "When prometheus unavailable, agents should fall back to local logging"
    - "If gitmcp fails, agents can use rust-mcp-filesystem as temporary storage"
    - "Memory server outages should trigger local caching with eventual consistency sync"

  observability:
    - "Every agent operation should create memory entities with timestamps"
    - "Use notion comments for human-readable status updates"
    - "prometheus metrics (when available) provide quantitative health signals"
    - "gmail notifications only for critical/blocking events to avoid noise"

  optimization_hints:
    - "Batch filesystem operations when possible (rust-mcp-filesystem)"
    - "Cache notion page queries to reduce API calls"
    - "Use playwright headless mode for faster test execution"
    - "Leverage dockerhub image caching to speed up container operations"
